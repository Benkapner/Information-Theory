Next we proceed with the encoding, where sequences outside of the typical set will be treated as errors. Hence, the probability of a sequence falling outside of the typical set is the complement of the probability of the typical set. Considering the previous example, the probability of the typical set is around $0.83$, therefore the probability of error will be around $1-0.83=0.16$ which is smaller than $0.18$. Finally, we proceed with the decoding. Once the encoded message is received, the decoder retrieves the corresponding sequence from the typical set.
